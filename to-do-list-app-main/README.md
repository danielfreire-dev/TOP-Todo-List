## About This Project
Building this app gave me a chance to further practice organizing my code with the module design pattern and save user data to local storage. 

### Requirements
- Users can
  - create to-do items
  - categorize to-do items into separate lists of to-dos
  - assign due dates and priority levels to to-do items
  - expand a to-do item to see its details, edit, or delete a to-do
- To-do items and lists are saved using the Web Storage API


## Lessons Learned

Whew! There were a lot of moving parts, from the to-do logic and DOM updates to getting the data to persist between browser sessions. I felt like I acquired a lot of new knowledge, patience, and grit over the course of this one project. 

JavaScript ES6 modules were used to stay organized and keep a separation of concerns, specifically, keep my DOM logic separate from my to-do logic. Right before this, I learned about the [SOLID principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) for writing better code, which influenced my pseudocode and eventually my code decisions here. There were still a lot of errors to troubleshoot and research, especially regarding the Web Storage API. I am thankful that I got to learn a lot about JSON and local/session storage throughout this process and even picked up a few new CSS tricks along the way.


## What I'd Like to Work On in the Future
- Add ability to sort to-do items and lists
- Add ability to move to-do items to another list
- Add notifications/pop-ups for confirming deletion, etc.
- Format displayed date
- Research and address accessibility concerns
- Make it mobile-friendly
